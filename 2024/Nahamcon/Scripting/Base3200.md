## Solution

1. Decompress using xz: `xz -d theflag`
2. Convert bytestream to readable string and repetedly decode 50 times with base64:

    ```python
    import base64

    # Read the Base64-encoded bytes from file
    with open('msg.txt', 'rb') as file:
        encoded_bytes = file.read().strip()

    # Perform 50 repetitions of decoding
    for _ in range(50):
        encoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(encoded_bytes)

    # Print the decoded result
    print(encoded_bytes.decode('utf-8'))
    ```
